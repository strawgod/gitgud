use this if u suck at the game

hax based off of exunys' original aimbot script
(yeah i found out he made a newer version after i made this one)

paired it up with a version of chams utilizing the highlight feature

you can configure some settings by using `_G.aimbot`
```
_G.aimbot.teamCheck = false
_G.aimbot.inputType = Enum.UserInputType.MouseButton2
```

you can also use it to enable or disable the hax entirely
```
_G.aimbot.enable()
_G.aimbot.disable() --wth do you think they do??
```

same for the chams
```
_G.outlines.create()
_G.outlines.clear()
```

cop the code by pasting everything in hax.lua or running this code
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strawgod/gitgud/main/hax.lua"))()
```

would say i made it for educational purposes but i'd be lying. it's fun using this stuff.
and as a guy who's trying to make games himself, if you don't have countermeasures in place
to prevent something as simple as this, you obviously don't care enough
